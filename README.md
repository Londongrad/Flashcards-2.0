A completed working flashcards app - version 2.0.

Unfortunately the 1.0 version has been lost.

The main problems are that the data from repos aren't stored in any kind of cache, so any changes in data won't update the UI, therefore new updated data should be provided from the database to display changes.

The second problem is that the dictor won't stop pronouncing a word after it has been switched to another.

In order to operate you have to use arrow keys. Up(save word as favorite), Down(Reveal the definition/termin), Left and Right(Move forward/back).
